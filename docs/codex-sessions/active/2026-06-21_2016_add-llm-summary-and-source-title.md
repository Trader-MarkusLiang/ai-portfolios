- Task: Add Volcengine Ark LLM summary and Discord source-aware title
- Status: in_progress
- Branch: main

## User request summary

Continue the existing investment brief project by adding LLM summarization using Volcengine Ark and improving Discord titles to show source usage.

## Work done

- Inspected the current multi-source Nitter/twitterapi.io pipeline.
- Validated Ark coding endpoint connectivity with model `kimi-k2.6`.
- Added prompt files and `src/summarize.py`.
- Wired `src/main.py`, workflow env vars, and Discord title output.
- Added KOL handles: Rocky (`Rocky_Bitcoin`), Serenity (`aleabitoreddit`), 潘驴邓晓闲缺一 (`JohnsonZ91127`).
- Added force lookback workflow input, LLM summary archive under `reports/summaries/`, and upgraded Discord-friendly report prompt.
- Added PDF rendering for Discord delivery while keeping Markdown summaries archived.
- Upgraded rendering plan to Markdown -> HTML/CSS -> Chromium PDF, with ReportLab fallback.
- Redesigned prompt around investment synthesis: consensus, disagreement, evidence strength, opportunity matrix, validation checklist.

## Decisions

- Use `kimi-k2.6` on `https://ark.cn-beijing.volces.com/api/coding/v3`.
- Keep graceful degradation: if LLM fails, still send the raw tweet report.
- Include source hit counts in the Discord title for quick diagnostics.

## Current state

- Prompt and summarizer modules exist.
- Main orchestration calls the summarizer and emits a source-aware Discord title.
- Current KOL config has three real accounts and no `elonmusk` sample account.
- Current KOL config has seven real accounts.
- Latest Actions run showed `nitter:7`, then `0 新` after `last_seen` was persisted. Use `force_lookback_days` for manual LLM testing.

## Resume instructions

- Read `src/main.py`, `src/summarize.py`, `.github/workflows/market-brief.yml`, and `README.md`.
- Ensure GitHub Secrets include `ARK_API_KEY`, `ARK_BASE_URL`, `ARK_MODEL`, and `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL`.
- Manually trigger `X Market Brief` in GitHub Actions and inspect Discord output.

## Open questions

- Remaining requested handles: 华尔街观察Xtrader, 库哥, 李志 | Rational Investing.
